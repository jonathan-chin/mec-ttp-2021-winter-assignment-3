# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 3: Responsive Comic Strip

## Purpose

To practice implementing responsive design principles through CSS frameworks, external CSS files, and nested HTML tags within the framing of building a multipanel comic strip.

## Task

You are going to create a single web page that displays several panels of a web comic that displays intelligently on multiple device environments. This means that the following variables, at the least, should change from device to device:

- number of panels in a straight row
- number of rows
- size of an individual comic panel
- size of a panel's image


## Requirements

You should produce a **single** HTML file, but may have numerous additional CSS and/or image files. Include any additional CSS as external files linked in your `<head></head>`. Images you use may be downloaded locally or referenced externally via url.

Your comic strip should include 4 panels per member of your team, generally for a total of 12 or 16. Remember again: all the panels should be on a single HTML page. A comic panel should include:

- Nested HTML so everything is under a single tag, probably a `<div></div>` or `<span></span>`
- An image, either created by you or taken from the web
- Text, either narrative and/or dialogue, wrapped in an appropriate HTML tag
- Styling to set it apart from other panels

## Reference Materials

You can download and use the `index.html` file in this repository as a starting point. It includes the Materialize CSS framework and sets up some meta tags.

You will probably need to brush up on `<img />`: [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)

You will also need to brush up on Materialize's grid system: [https://materializecss.com/grid.html](https://materializecss.com/grid.html)

## Caveats

You don't need to be a renaissance artist for this! You can create tremendous work with just black and white stick figures:

## Workflow

Be sure to use the collaborative and git workflows we discussed the last few classes and demonstrated at today's fishbowl. While the initial learning process might be bumpy, you will have a much smoother experience once you've started mastering it.

## Extension

If you want extra practice, try to rework your comic so that panels aren't all the same size. Have some panels twice or triple the width of other panels. For example:

## Submission

Submit a single github link before 11:59pm EST on Jan 8, 2021 using the following form. Only one student on your team needs to submit and be sure to tag all the team members when submitting.
